## How To Use
To use the Cerdas GPS Tracker, you need to program the board according to your requirements. We provide hardware test firmware that can be uploaded via the Arduino IDE to test all sensors and components. Before starting, ensure:

1. You have installed the necessary libraries.
2. Adjust the upload settings in your Arduino IDE.
3. The Cerdas GPS Tracker is in download mode.

#### Required Libraries:
- [RV-3028_C7-Arduino_Library](https://github.com/constiko/RV-3028_C7-Arduino_Library) by Constantin Koch
- [SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library) by Sparkfun
- [Adafruit_GPS](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_GPS) by Adafruit

#### Arduino IDE Settings:
- Board Name: **ESP32S3 Dev Module**
- USB CDC on Boot: **Enabled**
- USB DFU on Boot: **Disabled**
- Upload Mode: **UART0 / Hardware CDC**
- USB Mode: **Hardware CDC / JTAG**

#### Entering Download Mode:
1. Press and hold the EN button while the board is off.
2. Turn on the board.
3. Release the EN button.
4. The board is now in download mode.

## Pins Configuration

#### GPIO Configuration
- **GPIO13:** Enable power for GPS, RTC RV-3028, and BNO080  
  *Set GPIO13 to LOW to turn off GPS, RTC, and IMU.*

#### SD Module Pins
- **SCK:** GPIO7
- **MISO:** GPIO6
- **MOSI:** GPIO8
- **CS:** GPIO5

#### I2C for RTC RV-3028 and BNO080
- **SDA:** GPIO41
- **SCL:** GPIO40

#### Serial Pins for GPS
- **RX:** GPIO21
- **TX:** GPIO17

#### Serial Pins for SIM800L
- **RX:** GPIO2
- **TX:** GPIO1

## Notice
To activate SIM800L, you must physically press the GSM power button a few seconds until the GSM Power LED is on. Currently, it cannot be activated through programming.
